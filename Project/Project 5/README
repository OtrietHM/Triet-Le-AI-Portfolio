# L06 – Object Detection Using Transfer Learning  
### ITAI 1378 – Computer Vision • Triet Le

## Overview  
This project applies pretrained object detection models to locate objects in images using bounding boxes. Transfer learning makes object detection efficient without training a model from scratch.

## Skills Learned  
- Using pretrained CNN detection models  
- Drawing bounding boxes on images  
- Confidence score interpretation  
- Working with image tensors  

## What This Notebook Does  
- Loads pretrained models  
- Runs inference on sample images  
- Visualizes detected objects  
- Shows bounding box coordinates and scores  

## Key Takeaways  
- Transfer learning drastically reduces training time  
- Detection accuracy varies by image quality  
- Threshold tuning affects the number of detections  

## How to Run  
Run the notebook in Google Colab.  
Dependencies are typically included in Colab; otherwise, install TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Technologies Used  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

## Future Improvements  
- Add real-time webcam detection  
- Compare YOLO vs SSD vs Faster-RCNN
