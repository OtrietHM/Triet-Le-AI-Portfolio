# Lab 09 – Hyperparameter Tuning  
### ITAI 1378 – Computer Vision • Triet Le

## Overview  
This lab teaches how model performance changes when adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, depth, and regularization settings.

## Skills Learned  
- Grid search & parameter sweeps  
- Evaluating model accuracy vs validation loss  
- Detecting overfitting and underfitting  
- Understanding learning curves  

## What This Notebook Does  
- Trains models with multiple hyperparameter settings  
- Records accuracy, loss, and other metrics  
- Visualizes model performance  
- Compares baseline vs tuned model  

## Key Takeaways  
- Small changes in parameters can greatly affect results  
- More complexity ≠ better performance  
- Good tuning helps balance bias and variance  

## How to Run  
Run in Jupyter or Google Colab.  
Install scikit-learn if needed:  

pip install scikit-learn
