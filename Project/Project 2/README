# L03 – Image Filters & Histogram Processing  
### ITAI 1378 – Computer Vision • Triet Le

## Overview  
This lab explores image enhancement techniques using filters and histogram manipulation. These operations help improve image clarity or extract useful features for computer vision models.

## Skills Learned  
- Applying blur and sharpening filters  
- Using Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filters  
- Visualizing histograms  
- Histogram equalization and contrast improvement  
- Understanding noise reduction techniques  

## What This Notebook Does  
- Loads an image and applies multiple filtering methods  
- Shows the effect of each filter on image sharpness and noise  
- Displays histogram distributions before and after processing  

## Key Takeaways  
- Filters enhance details or reduce noise depending on how they’re used  
- Histogram equalization improves contrast in low-light images  
- Smoothing filters help CNNs by reducing irrelevant noise  

## How to Run  
1. Open in Jupyter or Google Colab  
2. Install OpenCV if needed  
3. Run cells sequentially to visualize results  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Future Improvements  
- Add Sobel and Canny edge detection  
- Compare histogram equalization vs CLAHE
