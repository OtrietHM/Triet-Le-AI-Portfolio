# L05 – CNN: Chihuahua vs Muffin Classifier  
### ITAI 1378 – Computer Vision • Triet Le

## Overview  
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of Chihuahuas and muffins—a fun but challenging task due to the visual similarity between the two classes.

## Skills Learned  
- Building CNN models for image classification  
- Understanding convolution, pooling, and feature extraction  
- Comparing CNNs vs traditional MLPs  
- Plotting accuracy/loss curves  
- Debugging training issues  

## What This Notebook Does  
- Loads a prepared Chihuahua & Muffin dataset  
- Builds a CNN architecture from scratch  
- Trains the model and evaluates accuracy  
- Visualizes predictions and misclassifications  
- Generates a confusion matrix  

## Key Findings  
- CNNs significantly outperform basic neural networks for images  
- Misclassifications often come from near-identical textures  
- Training stability depends heavily on learning rate and batch size  

## How to Run  
Use Google Colab or a local GPU if available:  

pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib
